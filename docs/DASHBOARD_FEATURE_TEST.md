# Dashboard Feature Test Register

Live QA register for **CA Dashboard** (`D:\New folder\Dashboard\CA Dashboard`).

**Test environment:** http://127.0.0.1:8000 (PHP built-in server + Vite)  
**Last run:** 2026-05-30 (go-live QA pass)  
**Roles:** `article`, `associate`, `partner` — see [FIRM_ROLES_AND_ACCESS.md](./FIRM_ROLES_AND_ACCESS.md)  
**Seeded logins:** `php artisan users:ensure-firm-logins` (new accounts print a one-time password)

**Register status:** All rows below are `[x]`, `[!]`, or `[—]` — **no `[ ]` untested rows** as of 2026-05-29.

**Automated live browser QA:** `npm run test:browser` — **72 checks passed** `(browser 2026-05-30)` — workload, collections, productivity reports, palette API, article → My Day

**Automated HTTP QA:** `php artisan test` — **272 tests, 1008 assertions** `(HTTP 2026-05-30)` including `GoLiveReadinessTest`, `FirmLiveQATest`, `DeepPostFlowTest`, `IntelligencePhase*Test`

**Go-live report:** [GO_LIVE_QA_REPORT.md](./GO_LIVE_QA_REPORT.md)

**Legend:** `[x]` checked OK · `[!]` bug found & fixed · `[—]` blocked by role (expected 403/redirect) · `[ ]` not yet tested  
**Evidence tags:** `(browser 2026-05-25)` article UX pass · `(browser 2026-05-29)` Playwright catalog · `(HTTP 2026-05-29)` PHPUnit

**Pending (ops, not app defects):** Production smoke at `https://app.kuhu.org.in` when network allows; live Meta WhatsApp + inbound webhook env on production — see [TEST_AND_HANDOFF_PLAN.md](./TEST_AND_HANDOFF_PLAN.md).

|----|-------|-----|--------|
| B-01 | Article saw sidebar links → 403 pages | Role-based sidebar in `layouts/app.blade.php` | Fixed |

## 14. Automated Tests Added

- `tests/Feature/DashboardNavigationTest.php` — article vs associate sidebar, finance KPI/tab hiding, client show finance, pagination
- `tests/Feature/FirmRolesTest.php` — partner, associate portfolio, article approval flow
- `tests/Feature/FirmLiveQATest.php` — HTTP verification aligned to this register (2026-05-29)
- `tests/Feature/DeepPostFlowTest.php` — billing process, invoice WhatsApp, service-due WhatsApp (mocked)
- Existing: `ClientVisibilityTest`, `CredentialVaultAuditTest`, `NewerModuleFlowTest`, policy tests, `SystemBackupTest`

Run full suite: `php artisan test` — **156 passed** (2026-05-29).  
Run live browser: `npm run test:browser` (requires `php artisan serve` + firm logins).

## 15. Questions for Product Owner

1. **Test roles:** Resolved — use seeded `partner`, `associate`, `article` via `users:ensure-firm-logins`.
2. **Article billing visibility:** Resolved — remain hidden on client show; associate sees read-only YTD/invoices.
3. **WhatsApp:** Mock in tests (`DeepPostFlowTest`); production needs real Meta credentials in `.env`.
4. **Production URL:** `.env` may use `https://app.kuhu.org.in` — smoke result recorded in `TEST_AND_HANDOFF_PLAN.md` § Production smoke.
5. **Leaves / Subscriptions / Billing:** Billing/subscriptions partner/manager only; leaves in Work Management sidebar when staff module enabled.

---

## 16. Next QA Steps

1. ~~Add partner/associate/article users~~ — Done: `php artisan users:ensure-firm-logins`.
2. ~~Complete POST/action testing~~ — Covered by `DeepPostFlowTest`, `NewerModuleFlowTest`, `FirmRolesTest` (HTTP). Optional: manual browser re-check on production.
3. ~~Run `php artisan test`~~ — Run before each deploy; counts synced in `TEST_AND_HANDOFF_PLAN.md`.
4. Optional: full browser pass on production URL after deploy.
